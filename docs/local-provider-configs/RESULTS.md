# Local Provider Testing Matrix — Results

Validated against live runs on **May 22, 2026**.

Compare each local provider's calibration output against the LM Studio MLX-8bit
baseline. All five serve the same `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf` (or
the equivalent MLX-8bit in LM Studio's case) so engine overhead is the only
variable.

Run order per provider:

1. Launch the provider (see provider-specific instructions in `README.md`)
2. `bash smoke-test.sh <provider-id>` — fills in the smoke columns below
3. In Merlin: Settings → Providers → enable provider + Refresh Models → pick model
4. Run `/calibrate` in Merlin against DeepSeek as the reference remote
5. Locate the report at `merlin-eval/results/CALIBRATION-harness-<timestamp>.md`
6. Record `overallLocalScore` and the per-category breakdown below

## Provider-specific outcomes

For each provider that surfaces something interesting (failure, surprising
score, performance anomaly, format quirk), drop a one-paragraph note here:

### lmstudio
Fully supported. General + vision pair passed live testing and the uncapped
timed calibration run.

### ollama
Not recommended. General calibration succeeded, but the tested vision model
failed on both `/v1/chat/completions` and `/api/chat` with the runner exiting
`EOF` / `exit status 2`. This is a runtime failure under real image load, not a
Merlin wiring problem.

### jan
Fully supported. General + vision pair passed live testing and timed
calibration. A first vision launch used the wrong GGUF filename, then passed
cleanly after correction.

### localai (native)
Fully supported. General + vision pair passed live testing and timed
calibration from one LocalAI instance.

### mistralrs
Currently unusable for the tested Qwen3-Coder-A3B GGUF model on Apple Metal.
Server binds and `/v1/models` returns, but the first real completion fails
because the MoE path reaches CUDA-only `indexed_moe_forward`. Upstream bug
filed: `EricLBuehler/mistral.rs#2160`.

### vllm (vLLM-Metal)
Not recommended. The general MLX model calibrated successfully, but the tested
vision runtime failed on the first real image request with:
`NotImplementedError: Multimodal encoder execution is not wired on Metal yet`.
That is an upstream runtime limitation, not a Merlin configuration issue.

## Upstream issue tracking — 2026-05-22

### Ollama
- [ollama/ollama#16264](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/16264) — imported `Qwen3-VL-8B` GGUF + `mmproj` registers as vision-capable on Apple Silicon, then crashes on the first real image request with `EOF` / `exit status 2`
- [ollama/ollama#13150](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/13150) — Qwen3-VL crashes with a nil-pointer dereference in the vision path and returns `500` / `EOF`
- [ollama/ollama#13113](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/13113) — Qwen3-VL crashes on small images before inference
- [ollama/ollama#13187](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/13187) — custom Qwen3-VL-MoE models fail even when they validate and run in other runtimes
- [ollama/ollama#15898](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/15898) — dual-`FROM` GGUF + `mmproj` loading fails for a related Qwen vision/MoE path because Ollama's vendored `llama.cpp` lacks the architecture support

### vllm-metal
- [vllm-project/vllm-metal#319](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/issues/319) — RFC to add end-to-end vision-language model support
- [vllm-project/vllm-metal#333](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/issues/333) — RFC to add the missing non-causal encoder-attention primitive needed for vision towers on Metal

### Mistral.rs
- [EricLBuehler/mistral.rs#2160](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/issues/2160) — tested GGUF Qwen3 MoE model loads on Metal, then fails on the first real inference via CUDA-only `indexed_moe_forward`
- [EricLBuehler/mistral.rs#2032](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/issues/2032) — related Qwen3.5 MoE Metal path still has shader and `indexed_moe_forward` gaps


## Takeaways — 2026-05-22

**Fully supported local providers:**
- **LM Studio**
- **Jan.ai**
- **LocalAI**

Each of those passed both model roles in a general+vision pair and completed a
timed calibration run.

**Not recommended local providers:**
- **Ollama** — general works, vision runner crashes on real image requests
- **vLLM-Metal** — general works, vision is upstream-blocked on Metal

**Currently unusable for the tested model:**
- **Mistral.rs** — the tested Qwen3 MoE GGUF path fails on first inference on
  Apple Metal

**Memory rule remains strict:** run one provider at a time, then shut it down.
Concurrent local daemons caused avoidable failures earlier in the sweep.
